# AutoClicker
This is a simple autoclicker written in python using the geekforgeeks tutorial online at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-make-a-python-auto-clicker/



To use this autoclicker first you must have python version 3.1

Download here:

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/

Download the recommended x64 version for Windows at bottom of the screen



Then you must download and ensure the pynput module is installed (detailed in first steps of geeksforgeeks link above) or follow these steps:


Press start

Type CMD then hit Enter

pip install pynput

hit Enter




Then you must open this python file and run by hitting the 'Run Module' button in the top tab of IDLE.

If issues persist with the pynput module you can check the version of python you are runnning by using the 'python --version' command in cmd and ensure you are running
version 3.10

You may also uninstall pynput by using the 'pip uninstall pynput' in cmd and reinstalling using the command 'pip3 -m pynput'

If there is no python installed on your machine after running the --version command you may need to navigate to the microsoft store and install:
